## Team Exercise for GitHub Training

1. Add a text message to the file which includes at least one spelling error and ends with your initials + date
(e.g. “I am not sure how to spell mispell! -RW (4/21/22)”)

2. The owner of the repository will review your Pull Request (PR) and suggest the appropriate changes

3. After your PR has been merged into the master repository, perform “fetch upstream” operations (for both fork & clone)

4. Verify your message has been updated correctly in all 3 places (master, fork, clone)
